# Defensive Programming

**Defensive Programming** is a design principle aimed at creating robust and reliable software that functions predictably even in the face of unexpected inputs or states. The core idea is to anticipate potential problems and guard against them.

The guiding philosophy is to be skeptical of all inputs and assumptions. Code should be written to "defend" itself against invalid data, errors from external systems, and other unforeseen circumstances.

## Core Philosophy: Trust, but Verify

The mindset of a defensive programmer is "trust nothing." This means assuming that:

-   **Inputs are potentially invalid:** Data coming from users, configuration files, or other parts of the system could be `null`, `undefined`, of the wrong type, or in an incorrect format.
-   **External systems are unreliable:** Network requests can fail, APIs can change their contract, and databases can be unavailable.
-   **Code will be misused:** Other developers (or your future self) might use your functions or classes in ways you didn't originally intend.

This contrasts with a pure "Offensive Programming" (or "Fail-Fast") approach. However, the relationship is nuanced. It's better to see Fail-Fast as one of the tools available to a defensive programmer. The choice depends on the context:

*   **Handle Gracefully:** For predictable errors or invalid external inputs (e.g., user input, network failures), a defensive approach provides a fallback or default behavior to ensure a smooth user experience.
*   **Fail Fast:** For internal logic errors (bugs) where a contract is violated, crashing immediately is the best defensive move. It prevents the error from propagating and causing more damage, making the bug easier to find and fix.

A robust system often uses both: graceful handling for external boundaries and failing fast for internal contract violations.

## Key Techniques & Application Areas

Defensive programming is not a single pattern but a collection of techniques applied across different domains.

### 1. Guarding Against Invalid Inputs (Guard Clauses)

This is the most common form of defensive programming. It involves checking the validity of function arguments at the very beginning of a function.

**Non-Defensive Example:**

```javascript
// This function will crash if 'user' is null or doesn't have a 'name' property.
function getWelcomeMessage(user) {
    return `Welcome, ${user.name.toUpperCase()}!`;
}
```

**Defensive Example with Guard Clauses:**

```javascript
function getWelcomeMessage(user) {
    // Guard against null/undefined user or name
    if (!user || typeof user.name !== 'string') {
        // Handle the error gracefully
        return 'Welcome, Guest!';
    }

    return `Welcome, ${user.name.toUpperCase()}!`;
}

// Test cases
console.log(getWelcomeMessage({ name: 'Alice' })); // "Welcome, ALICE!"
console.log(getWelcomeMessage({})); // "Welcome, Guest!"
console.log(getWelcomeMessage(null)); // "Welcome, Guest!"
```

### 2. Handling External Dependencies & API Calls

Never assume an external service is infallible. Network calls should always be wrapped in error handling, and the data returned should be validated.

**Non-Defensive Example:**

```javascript
// This will crash if the network fails or the API returns an unexpected shape.
async function fetchUsername(userId) {
    const response = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${userId}`);
    const data = await response.json();
    return data.profile.displayName;
}
```

**Defensive Example:**

```javascript
async function fetchUsername(userId) {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${userId}`);

        // Guard against network errors (e.g., 404, 500)
        if (!response.ok) {
            console.error(`API request failed with status: ${response.status}`);
            return 'Unknown User';
        }

        const data = await response.json();

        // Guard against unexpected data shape (using optional chaining)
        const displayName = data?.profile?.displayName;
        if (!displayName) {
            console.error('displayName not found in API response');
            return 'Unknown User';
        }

        return displayName;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Network error or invalid JSON:', error);
        return 'Unknown User';
    }
}
```

### 3. Preventing Unintended State Mutations (Immutability)

Defensive programming also applies to protecting data structures from being changed unexpectedly. This is especially important in languages where objects and arrays are passed by reference. This principle is a cornerstone of [[functional-programming|Functional Programming]], which favors pure functions that do not produce side effects like modifying external state.

**Non-Defensive Example (mutates original array):**

```javascript
function sortAndReturnTop(scores) {
    // This sort() method modifies the original 'scores' array, which might be a surprise to the caller.
    return scores.sort((a, b) => b - a).slice(0, 3);
}

const myScores = [88, 95, 100, 75];
const topScores = sortAndReturnTop(myScores);
console.log(topScores); // [100, 95, 88]
console.log(myScores);  // [100, 95, 88, 75] -> The original array has been changed!
```

**Defensive Example (operates on a copy):**

```javascript
function sortAndReturnTop(scores) {
    // Guard: ensure scores is an array
    if (!Array.isArray(scores)) {
        return [];
    }

    // Create a copy to avoid mutating the original array
    const scoresCopy = [...scores];
    return scoresCopy.sort((a, b) => b - a).slice(0, 3);
}

const myScores = [88, 95, 100, 75];
const topScores = sortAndReturnTop(myScores);
console.log(topScores); // [100, 95, 88]
console.log(myScores);  // [88, 95, 100, 75] -> The original array is preserved.
```

## Benefits & Downsides

**Benefits:**

-   **Increased Robustness:** The application is more resilient to errors and unexpected conditions.
-   **Improved Security:** Validating inputs helps prevent common security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
-   **Easier Debugging:** Defensive checks can pinpoint where invalid data is entering the system.

**Downsides:**

-   **Code Clutter:** Overuse can make code verbose and harder to read.
-   **Performance Overhead:** The additional checks consume CPU cycles, though this is often negligible.
-   **Masking Bugs:** Poorly implemented defensive code can hide underlying bugs by swallowing errors, making them harder to find and fix. It's crucial to log swallowed errors.

## Relationship with Other Concepts

-   **Fail-Fast:** Rather than being a true opposite, Fail-Fast is a specific *strategy* within a defensive mindset. When a defensive check reveals an *internal* state that should be impossible (a contract violation, indicating a bug), the most defensive action is to "fail fast" by throwing an exception. This prevents the corrupted state from spreading and makes the bug's origin immediately obvious. This is different from gracefully handling expected external failures (like API errors), where the program should continue to run.
-   **Design by Contract:** This is a more formal approach to defensive programming where preconditions (what must be true before a function runs), postconditions (what must be true after), and invariants (what must always be true) are explicitly defined and checked.
