# Design by Contract (DbC)

**Design by Contract (DbC)** is a software design methodology that uses formal, precise, and verifiable interface specifications for software components. The core idea is that software components should cooperate based on a clear "contract," much like a business contract between a client and a supplier.

Introduced by Bertrand Meyer, the creator of the Eiffel programming language, DbC views software construction as being based on components whose interactions are governed by mutual obligations and benefits.

## The Client-Supplier Analogy

DbC is best understood through the lens of a client (a piece of code calling a method) and a supplier (the method being called). Their contract defines:

-   **The Supplier's Obligations:** What the supplier must provide (the result).
-   **The Supplier's Benefits:** What the supplier can assume to be true before starting its work (the inputs).
-   **The Client's Obligations:** What the client must provide to the supplier (the inputs).
-   **The Client's Benefits:** What the client can expect to receive (the result).

This relationship is formalized through three key concepts: **preconditions**, **postconditions**, and **invariants**.

---

## The Three Core Concepts

### 1. Preconditions

A precondition is a condition that must be true **before** a method is invoked. It is the client's responsibility to satisfy the precondition. If the precondition is not met, the supplier is not obligated to do anythingâ€”it is free to crash, produce incorrect results, or do nothing at all.

-   **Responsibility:** The **Client** (caller).
-   **Purpose:** Defines the valid inputs and state required for the method to run.

**Example (using assertions to check preconditions):**

```javascript
// A bank account that cannot have a negative balance.
class BankAccount {
    constructor(balance = 0) {
        if (balance < 0) throw new Error('Initial balance cannot be negative.');
        this.balance = balance;
    }

    /**
     * @param {number} amount The amount to withdraw.
     * @precondition amount > 0
     * @precondition this.balance >= amount
     */
    withdraw(amount) {
        // Precondition Check 1: Amount must be positive.
        if (amount <= 0) {
            throw new Error('Withdrawal amount must be positive.');
        }
        // Precondition Check 2: Sufficient funds must be available.
        if (this.balance < amount) {
            throw new Error('Insufficient funds.');
        }

        this.balance -= amount;
    }
}
```
In this case, the caller of `withdraw` is obligated to provide a positive `amount` that does not exceed the current balance.

### 2. Postconditions

A postcondition is a condition that the method **guarantees** will be true **after** it finishes executing successfully. It is the supplier's responsibility to satisfy the postcondition.

-   **Responsibility:** The **Supplier** (the method itself).
-   **Purpose:** Defines the outcome, results, and state changes the method promises to deliver.

**Example (checking postconditions):**

```javascript
class BankAccount {
    // ... (constructor and other methods)

    /**
     * @param {number} amount The amount to withdraw.
     * @postcondition this.balance == old(this.balance) - amount
     */
    withdraw(amount) {
        // Precondition checks...
        if (amount <= 0 || this.balance < amount) { /* ... throw errors ... */ }

        const balanceBefore = this.balance;

        // Action
        this.balance -= amount;

        // Postcondition Check: Ensure the balance was updated correctly.
        // In a language with native DbC, this would be automatic.
        // In JavaScript, we can use an assertion for testing/debugging.
        console.assert(this.balance === balanceBefore - amount, 'Postcondition failed: Balance incorrect after withdrawal.');
    }
}
```

### 3. Invariants

An invariant is a condition for a class that must be true **whenever the object is publicly accessible**. This means it must be true after the constructor has run and before and after every public method call. Invariants ensure the object remains in a consistent, valid state.

-   **Responsibility:** The **Supplier** (the class as a whole).
-   **Purpose:** Defines the fundamental consistency and integrity of an object.

**Example (checking an invariant):**

```javascript
class BankAccount {
    constructor(balance = 0) {
        this.balance = balance;
        this.checkInvariant(); // Check after creation
    }

    // The invariant: The balance can never be negative.
    checkInvariant() {
        if (this.balance < 0) {
            throw new Error('Invariant violated: Balance cannot be negative.');
        }
    }

    withdraw(amount) {
        this.checkInvariant(); // Check before method
        // Preconditions...

        this.balance -= amount;

        this.checkInvariant(); // Check after method
    }

    deposit(amount) {
        this.checkInvariant(); // Check before method
        // Preconditions...

        this.balance += amount;

        this.checkInvariant(); // Check after method
    }
}
```

## Benefits of Design by Contract

-   **Improved Reliability:** It forces developers to think rigorously about component responsibilities, leading to more robust code.
-   **Clear Documentation:** Contracts act as a precise form of technical documentation, explaining what a component does and how to use it.
-   **Enhanced Debugging:** When a contract is violated, the system fails immediately at the source of the error (the bug is in the client if a precondition fails, or the supplier if a postcondition fails), making debugging much faster. It is a systematic way to implement a **Fail-Fast** strategy.
-   **Facilitates Automated Testing:** Contracts can be used as a basis for generating test cases.

## Relationship with Other Concepts

-   **[[defensive-programming|Defensive Programming]]:** DbC is a formal and structured way to implement defensive checks. While general defensive programming might handle errors gracefully (e.g., returning a default value), DbC typically advocates for failing fast when a contract is broken, as a contract violation signals a bug.
-   **[[fail-fast|Fail-Fast]]:** DbC is one of the most systematic ways to implement a Fail-Fast strategy. A contract violation is a clear signal that the system is in an invalid state, and execution should be halted immediately.
-   **[[solid|Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)]]:** DbC provides the rules for applying LSP correctly in object-oriented programming. For a subclass to be a valid substitute for its superclass, it must adhere to the parent's contract:
    -   It must not strengthen the preconditions (it must accept at least everything the parent accepts).
    -   It must not weaken the postconditions or the invariants (it must guarantee at least everything the parent guarantees).
