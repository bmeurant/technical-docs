# Architecture Styles

An **architectural style** is a high-level design approach that defines the overall structure and fundamental properties of a software system. It is a set of principles and constraints that dictate how components interact, such as in a [[client-server|Client-Server]] or [[microservices|Microservices]] architecture. The goal of a style is to address key non-functional requirements like scalability, security, and performance. Selecting a style is the first major architectural decision and influences all subsequent design choices. The classification of styles is not always clear and can vary among authors and contexts; for example, what some consider a style ([[event-driven|Event-Driven]]) may be based on patterns. All of these styles provide a common vocabulary for discussing global design strategies. To learn more about the more specific design building blocks, please refer to the "[[software-architecture/architectural-patterns/|Architectural Patterns]]" page.
