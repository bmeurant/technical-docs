# Monolithic Architecture

**Monolithic architecture** is a software design style where the entire application is built as a **single, indivisible deployment unit**. All application functionalities (the user interface, business logic, and data access) are packaged into a single artifact, which is then deployed to a single server or a cluster of servers acting as a unified entity.

* **Key Principles:**
    * **Single Codebase:** The application is a single project with one source code repository.
    * **Single Process:** The entire application runs within a single operating system process.
    * **Tight Coupling:** The different modules of the application communicate directly via local method or function calls, making them highly dependent on each other.
    * **Shared Resources:** Modules share the same in-memory resources and often connect to a single, shared database.

## Overview and Communication Flow

The most generic and specific diagram for a monolith highlights its unified nature, contrasting it with a distributed architecture like microservices.

```mermaid

    subgraph Frontend
        A[Web/Mobile Client]
    end

    subgraph The Internet
        B[Internet/Network]
    end

    subgraph Monolith
        C[Monolith Application]
    end

    subgraph Database
        D[Shared Database]
    end

    A -- "Requests" --> B
    B -- "Requests" --> C
    C -- "Queries/Updates" --> D
    D -- "Data" --> C
    C -- "Responses" --> B
    B -- "Responses" --> A
```

1. A **Client** (web browser, mobile app) sends requests to the application.

2. The entire **Monolithic Application** handles all requests, processes the business logic, and accesses the database.

3. The **Database** is a shared resource, common to all application functionalities.

## Advantages and Challenges (Technical and Operational)

* **Advantages (Benefits):**
    * **Development and Deployment Simplicity:** A single codebase and a single binary to deploy. This makes Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines initially simple and fast for a small team.
    * **High-Performance Communication:** Communication between components are local function calls, without the latency and overhead of network calls.
    * **Low Initial Cost:** Minimal startup and hosting costs, making it ideal for an **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** or a small project.

* **Challenges:**
    * **Scalability:** The main challenge. You cannot scale a single feature. The entire application must be duplicated (multiple instances of the monolith), which can be very expensive and inefficient. This is known as **coarse-grained scaling**.
    * **Maintenance and Comprehension:** The codebase can grow into a "Big Ball of Mud" where changes are risky and dependencies are difficult to manage.
    * **Team Scalability:** It's difficult for multiple teams to work in parallel on a single codebase. Code conflicts and bottlenecks become frequent.
    * **Technology Lock-in:** Once the core technology is chosen, it's very difficult to change it for only one part of the application, as everything is tightly coupled.
    * **Single Point of Failure:** A bug in one module can potentially cause the entire application to crash.
