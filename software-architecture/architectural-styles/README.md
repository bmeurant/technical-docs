# Software Architectural Styles

Software architecture is the **high-level structure** of a software system, defining the **fundamental organization** of its components and their **relationships**. An architectural style is a set of principles that guides this design, ensuring the system is **well-structured**, **scalable**, and **maintainable**. 

These documents outlines several common architectural styles with concrete examples, strength and weaknesses to aid in understanding.
