# Message-Driven vs. Event-Driven Architectures

**Message-Driven Architecture (MDA)** is a foundational architectural style based on asynchronous message passing. Components communicate by sending messages to each other through a **[[broker]]**, without being directly connected.

The key to understanding MDA and its most famous variant, **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)**, lies in the *semantic intent* of the messages being passed.

*   **Command Message:** A message that instructs a service to perform a specific action (e.g., `ProcessPayment`). It is directed, imperative, and expects a specific recipient to act on it.
*   **Event Message:** A message that notifies the system that a significant state change has occurred (e.g., `PaymentProcessed`). It is a statement of past fact, and the producer is unaware of who, if anyone, is listening.

An architecture's nature—whether it's primarily command-driven or event-driven—is determined by the type of messages it uses.

## Command-Driven vs. Event-Driven Messaging

| Characteristic | Command-Driven (MDA) | Event-Driven (EDA) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Message Intent** | **Imperative**: "Do this thing." (e.g., `ProcessPayment`) | **Declarative**: "This thing happened." (e.g., `PaymentProcessed`) |
| **Recipient** | Addressed to a **specific logical recipient** or component responsible for that action. | Broadcast to **any and all interested parties**. The producer is unaware of the consumers. |
| **Coupling** | **Looser than RPC**, but still implies a 1-to-1 logical relationship between the sender and the receiver of the command. | **Extremely loose coupling**. The producer and consumers are completely decoupled. |
| **Typical Channel** | **[[asynchronous-messaging|Queue]]**. A command should be handled by a single consumer. | **[[asynchronous-messaging|Topic/Stream]]**. An event can be processed by multiple independent consumers. |
| **Use Case** | Distributing tasks to a worker pool, decoupling a monolithic process, ensuring a specific action is performed. | Notifying other parts of a system of a state change, enabling reactive and emergent workflows. |
