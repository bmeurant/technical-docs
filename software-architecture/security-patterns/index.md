1.  **[3 Security Patterns | System Design Interview | Federated Identity, Gatekeeper, Valet Key](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtG05JdHyMM)**

    This video from SoftwareDude provides a concise overview of three critical security patterns for modern cloud and microservices environments: [[federated-identity|Federated Identity]], [[gatekeeper|Gatekeeper]], and [[valet-key|Valet Key]]. It is an excellent resource for system design interviews, as it clearly explains how each pattern addresses common security challenges in distributed systems.

2.  **[12- Microservices design patterns | Federated Identity and Valet Key design patterns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_itCC15DLuQ)**

    This video from TECHHUB offers a focused look at two important microservices security patterns: [[federated-identity|Federated Identity]] and [[valet-key|Valet Key]]. The content covers the fundamental concepts, implementation best practices, and the specific problems that these patterns solve, making it a valuable guide for developers and architects working with microservices.
