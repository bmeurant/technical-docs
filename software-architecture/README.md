# Software Design and Architecture

A list of topics related to Software design and architecture principles, styles, patterns, practices, etc.

The aim is to offer a set of introductory resources on the various notions and concepts in the field to support training and self-training activities, as well as to provide a non-exhaustive list of the main issues and solutions.

To this end, this section draws on the excellent roadmap.sh tool, which can be used to define a complete map of the concepts and notions relating to a given subject.
