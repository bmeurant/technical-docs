# System Design Components

Architectural components are the concrete, high-level building blocks used to construct a system. They represent major categories of software or infrastructure that fulfill specific roles within an architecture.

This section covers the core components used in modern system design.

## Context in System Design

In the broader landscape of [[software-architecture/|Software Architecture]], system design components serve as the tangible elements that implement the principles defined in [[software-architecture/system-design-fundamentals/|System Design Fundamentals]] and realize the structures described by [[software-architecture/system-design-patterns/|System Design Patterns]].

*   **[[software-architecture/system-design-fundamentals/|System Design Fundamentals]]** provide the underlying theoretical concepts and universal principles (e.g., HTTP, Caching, CAP Theorem) that inform how components should behave.
*   **[[software-architecture/system-design-patterns/|System Design Patterns]]** offer proven solutions for recurring problems, often describing how to combine and interact with various components to achieve specific goals (e.g., Load Balancing, Circuit Breaker).
*   **System Design Components** are the actual software or hardware entities (e.g., Web Servers, Databases, Message Brokers) that embody these fundamentals and are orchestrated by these patterns to form a complete system.
