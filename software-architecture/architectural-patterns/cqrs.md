# CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

**CQRS** is an [[software-architecture/architectural-patterns/|architectural pattern]] that separates the model for writing data (the **Command** side) from the model for reading data (the **Query** side). While in traditional architectures the same data model is used for both reading and writing, CQRS proposes that these two aspects have very different requirements and should be optimized independently.

* **Core Principles:**
    * **[[soc|Separation of Concerns]]:** The core idea is to have two distinct models:
        * The **Write Model** (or Command Model) is optimized for validation, business logic execution, and consistency. It processes commands and produces events or state changes.
        * The **Read Model** (or Query Model) is a denormalized and optimized representation of the data, designed specifically for efficient querying and display.
    * **Asymmetrical Models:** The write model can be a fully normalized, transactional database, while the read model could be a NoSQL database, a full-text search index, or simply materialized views.
    * **Data Synchronization:** The read model is updated based on changes occurring in the write model. This synchronization is often asynchronous, leading to eventual consistency.

## Key Components and Communication Flow

The flow starts with a client's intent, which is either a Command or a Query.

sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant CommandBus as Command Bus
    participant WriteModel as Write Model (Aggregate)
    participant EventStore as Event Store / DB
    participant EventBus as Event Bus
    participant ReadModelUpdater as Read Model Updater
    participant ReadModel as Read Model (DB)
    participant QueryBus as Query Bus

    Client->>CommandBus: 1. Send Command (e.g., CreateUser)
    CommandBus->>WriteModel: 2. Handle Command
    activate WriteModel
    WriteModel->>EventStore: 3. Persist State/Events
    deactivate WriteModel
    EventStore->>EventBus: 4. Publish Event (e.g., UserCreated)
    
    EventBus-->>ReadModelUpdater: 5. Consume Event
    activate ReadModelUpdater
    ReadModelUpdater->>ReadModel: 6. Update Read DB
    deactivate ReadModelUpdater

    Client->>QueryBus: 7. Send Query (e.g., GetUserDetails)
    QueryBus->>ReadModel: 8. Fetch Data
    ReadModel-->>Client: 9. Return DTO
```

1.  **Command:** An object representing an intent to change the state of the system (e.g., `UpdateUserAddress`). It is [[imperative-programming|imperative]] and should not return data.
2.  **Write Model:** Handles the command, executes business rules, and persists the state change. In an [[event-sourcing|Event Sourcing]] context, this would be an **Aggregate** that produces events.
3.  **Write Database:** The data store for the write model. It is optimized for writes (e.g., a normalized SQL database or an Event Store).
4.  **Data Synchronization Mechanism:** A process that updates the read model. This is often done by publishing events from the write model (e.g., via a message bus) that the read side subscribes to.
5.  **Read Model:** A denormalized data store optimized for queries. It can be a NoSQL database, a search index, or any other suitable storage. It is essentially a materialized view of the data.
6.  **Query:** A request for data that does not change the state of the system. It returns a Data Transfer Object (DTO).

## Advantages and Technical Challenges

* **Advantages (Benefits):**
    * **Scalability:** The read and write workloads can be scaled independently. You can add more nodes to your read cluster to handle high query volumes without impacting the write side.
    * **Performance:** Each model can be aotomized with the best data store for its task. The read model can be denormalized to avoid complex joins, leading to very fast queries.
    * **Flexibility & Simplicity:** The write model can focus solely on business logic and transactional consistency without being polluted by read concerns. The read model is simple and doesn't contain complex business logic.
    * **Security:** It's easier to enforce security rules by restricting access to the command side.

* **Challenges:**
    * **Increased Complexity:** This is not a pattern for simple applications. It introduces more components and moving parts (e.g., data synchronization).
    * **Eventual Consistency:** Since the read model is updated asynchronously, there is a delay before changes are visible to the query side. The UI must be designed to handle this (e.g., by showing optimistic updates).
    * **Data Synchronization Logic:** The mechanism to update the read model must be robust and reliable. If events are lost, the read model becomes permanently inconsistent. Patterns like the **Transactional Outbox** can help.
    * **Development Overhead:** Requires a different way of thinking and more initial setup compared to a traditional CRUD approach.

## Related Patterns, Concepts and Variations

CQRS is often used with other patterns to build robust and scalable systems.

*   **[[event-sourcing|Event Sourcing]]:** CQRS and Event Sourcing are a natural fit. In this combination, the write model is an [[event-sourcing|Event Sourced]] system that persists a log of events. The read model is built by subscribing to these events and creating projections.
*   **[[microservices|Microservices]]:** In a microservices architecture, a single service might own the write model for a specific domain, while multiple other services could own different read models of that same data, tailored for their specific needs.
*   **Materialized View:** The read model in CQRS is essentially a materialized view of the write model's data.
*   **Transactional Outbox:** A pattern to ensure that events are reliably published to the message bus after the state has been successfully persisted in the write database.
