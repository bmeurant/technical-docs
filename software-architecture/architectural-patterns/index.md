# Architecture Patterns

An **architectural pattern** is a reusable, concrete solution to a recurring design problem, often applicable to the internal organization of modules or services. While a style is a blueprint for the entire house, a pattern is a blueprint for a specific room or system inside that house, like the plumbing. Typical examples include **Hexagonal Architecture**, which organizes business logic by isolating it from external dependencies, the [[mvc|Model-View-Controller (MVC)]] pattern, which organizes user interface logic, or the [[event-driven#Event Sourcing|Event Sourcing]] pattern, which manages data persistence. The commonality with styles, as explained on the "[[../architectural-styles/index|Architectural Styles]]" page, is that both provide proven solutions to design problems. The key difference lies in their scope: patterns define an organization at the scale of a subsystem or module, **without dictating the global structure of the entire system**, while styles define the organization of the entire ecosystem.
