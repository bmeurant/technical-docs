# Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern

The **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** [[software-architecture/architectural-patterns/|architectural pattern]] is a fundamental design pattern used to develop user interfaces. Its main objective is to separate an application into three interconnected and well-defined components to manage complexity.

* **Core Principles:**
    * **[[soc|Separation of Concerns]]:** MVC clearly separates responsibilities. The **Model** handles data and business logic, the **View** is responsible for presentation to the user, and the **Controller** acts as an intermediary, handling user input and orchestrating interactions between the Model and the View.
    * **[[cohesion-coupling|Loose Coupling]]:** The components are designed to be as independent as possible. The Controller does not need to know the implementation details of the View, and the Model is completely independent of the UI. This increases the reusability and testability of the components.
    * **Triadic Interaction:** The pattern implements a specific communication flow. The user interacts with the View, which triggers an action in the Controller. The Controller updates the Model, which in turn can notify the View of any changes so it can refresh itself.

## Key Components

1.  **Model:** The core of the application. It is the object that contains the **data** and the **business logic**. It is completely unaware of Views and Controllers. Its role is to manage the application's state and notify its [[gof|observers]] (often the Views) when its data changes.
2.  **View:** This is the user interface. It presents the Model's information to the user. The View does not contain business logic; it simply displays the data and sends user inputs to the Controller. There can be multiple Views for a single Model.
3.  **Controller:** The intermediary. It receives user inputs (via the View), interprets these actions, and updates the Model accordingly. It then selects the appropriate View to display.

## Interaction Models: Active vs. Passive MVC

The interaction between the components can vary, leading to two main interpretations of the pattern.

### 1. Active MVC (Classic MVC)

This is the original model, common in desktop GUI applications. In this version, the **View actively observes the Model** for changes using the **[[gof|Observer pattern]]**. The Controller's only job is to handle user input and update the Model.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant View
    participant Controller
    participant Model

    User->>View: Interacts (e.g., clicks button)
    View->>Controller: Forwards user action
    activate Controller
    Controller->>Model: Updates state
    deactivate Controller
    activate Model
    Model-->>View: Notifies of change (Observer pattern)
    deactivate Model
    activate View
    View->>Model: Pulls updated data
    View->>View: Refreshes display
    deactivate View
```

**Data Flow (Active MVC):**
1.  The user interacts with the **View**.
2.  The **View** calls the **Controller**, passing along the user's action.
3.  The **Controller** updates the **Model**.
4.  The **Model**, having changed its state, notifies all its observers (the **View**).
5.  The **View** receives the notification and pulls the updated data directly from the **Model** to refresh its display.

### 2. Passive MVC (Web MVC)

This is the model most commonly found in web application frameworks. In this version, the **Controller is more central**. It updates the Model and then prepares the data for the View, often passing a data transfer object (DTO) to it. The View is entirely passive and does not interact with the Model directly.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant View
    participant Controller
    participant Model

    User->>Controller: Sends HTTP Request
    activate Controller
    Controller->>Model: Updates state
    activate Model
    Model-->>Controller: Returns updated data
    deactivate Model
    Controller->>View: Renders with data
    deactivate Controller
    activate View
    View-->>User: Sends HTTP Response
    deactivate View
```

**Data Flow (Passive MVC):**
1.  The user sends an HTTP request, which is routed to a specific **Controller** action.
2.  The **Controller** processes the request and updates the **Model**.
3.  The **Controller** then selects a **View** and passes the necessary data (often as a DTO) to it.
4.  The **View** renders itself using the data provided by the Controller and sends the final HTTP response to the user. The View does not know that the Model exists.

## Advantages and Technical Challenges

* **Advantages (Benefits):**
    * **Enhanced Organization:** The architecture clearly separates responsibilities, making the code easier to understand and maintain, especially in complex applications.
    * **Testability:** Since the Model and Controller are separate from the View, they can be tested independently (**unit testing**) without needing a graphical interface.
    * **Parallel Development:** Different development teams can work simultaneously on the three components without blocking each other; for example, one team can focus on the front-end (View) while another develops the back-end (Model and Controller).
    * **Reusability:** The Model can be reused by multiple different Views. For example, the same data can be displayed on a web interface and a mobile application.

* **Challenges:**
    * **Increased Complexity:** For simple applications, implementing the pattern can be overkill and make the project more complex than it needs to be.
    * **The "Fat Controller" Anti-Pattern:** A common pitfall is placing business logic inside the Controller instead of the Model. This leads to "Fat Controllers" that are bloated, hard to test, and violate the [[soc|separation of concerns]]. The Controller's role should be limited to input processing and coordinating calls to the Model, not implementing business rules itself.
    * **Learning Curve:** The complexity of MVC is relative. While the basic concept is simple to understand, its correct implementation, particularly in avoiding the trap of "Fat Controllers" where business logic accumulates in the controller, can present a challenge. For novice developers, learning the flow of indirect interactions between the three components and the specific implementation in different frameworks can also require an initial effort, although the pattern remains an excellent starting point for modern application architecture.

## Related Patterns, Concepts and Variations

The MVC pattern has given rise to [[mvw|several variants]] that attempt to solve its challenges and adapt to new environments, particularly the web.

* **[[mvp|Model-View-Presenter (MVP)]]:** The Presenter is a stronger intermediary than the Controller. It manipulates the View directly via an interface, making the View passive and easier to test. This is a common model in **Android** applications.
* **[[mvvm|Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)]]:** The ViewModel acts as an abstraction layer between the View and the Model. It exposes data and commands through **"bindings,"** allowing the View to update automatically when the data changes, without direct interaction. This is the pattern behind frameworks like **Angular** and **Vue.js**.

This pattern, though dating back to the 1970s, remains the foundation for many modern frameworks and is essential for understanding web and mobile application architectures.
