# Databases in System Design

Choosing the right database is one of the most critical decisions in system design. The choice impacts [[system-design-fundamentals#Performance-vs-Scalability|performance]], [[system-design-fundamentals#Scalability|scalability]], data integrity, and the overall complexity of the system. A database model that excels for one use case can be a poor fit for another.

This section introduces the two major families of databases—[[rdbms|SQL]] and [[nosql|NoSQL]] —and explores the fundamental trade-offs between them.

## The Fundamental Trade-Off: SQL vs. NoSQL

The primary difference between [[rdbms|SQL]] and [[nosql|NoSQL]]  lies in how they model, store, and retrieve data, which in turn dictates their strengths in consistency, scalability, and flexibility.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "SQL (Relational)"
        direction LR
        Table1[Users Table] --> Table2[Orders Table]
    end
    subgraph "NoSQL (Document)"
        Doc["User Document {<br>  name: 'Alice',<br>  orders: [ ... ]<br>}"]
    end
```
*Description: [[rdbms|SQL databases]]  use a structured, tabular format with relationships between tables. [[nosql|NoSQL databases]]  often use flexible formats like JSON documents where related data can be embedded.*

### SQL (Relational) Databases

[[rdbms|Relational databases]] , which use Structured Query Language (SQL), have been the standard for decades. They organize data into tables with rows and columns, and enforce a predefined schema.

-   **Data Model:** Structured and tabular.
-   **Schema:** Fixed and defined before data is inserted. Enforces data integrity.
-   **Key Strength:** Guarantees **ACID** transactions (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), making them extremely reliable for financial and mission-critical data.
-   **Querying:** [[rdbms|SQL]] is an extremely powerful language for performing complex queries, aggregations, and JOINs across multiple tables.
-   **Scalability:** Traditionally scale **[[system-design-fundamentals#Scalability|vertically]]** (by increasing the power of a single server). While modern RDBMS have better horizontal scaling, it is generally more complex than in [[nosql|NoSQL]]  systems.
-   **Examples:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle.

### NoSQL (Non-Relational) Databases

[[nosql|NoSQL databases]]  emerged to meet the demands of large-scale, distributed systems where the rigid structure of [[rdbms|SQL]] was a bottleneck. They encompass a wide variety of data models.

-   **Data Model:** Highly flexible, including Key-Value, Document, Column-family, and Graph models.
-   **Schema:** Dynamic or schema-less. You can add new fields without redefining the entire database structure.
-   **Key Strength:** Designed for **[[system-design-fundamentals#Scalability|horizontal scaling]]** (scaling out by adding more servers). They often prioritize performance and [[system-design-patterns/availability-patterns|availability]] over [[system-design-patterns/consistency-patterns#Strong-Consistency|strong consistency]], aligning with the **BASE** model (Basically Available, Soft state, [[system-design-patterns/consistency-patterns#Eventual-Consistency|Eventually consistent]]).
-   **Querying:** Query languages vary by database and are often less powerful than SQL for complex joins.
-   **Trade-offs:** The flexibility and scalability often come at the cost of weaker consistency guarantees, as explained in the [[cap|CAP Theorem]].
-   **Examples:** MongoDB (Document), Redis (Key-Value), Cassandra (Wide-column), Neo4j (Graph).
-   **Learn more:** [[nosql|NoSQL Databases]]

## At a Glance: SQL vs. NoSQL

| Feature | SQL (RDBMS) | NoSQL |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Model** | Structured (Tables with rows/columns) | Flexible (Documents, Key-Value, etc.) |
| **Schema** | Rigid, predefined | Dynamic |
| **Scalability** | Vertical (Scale-up) | Horizontal (Scale-out) |
| **Consistency** | Strong (ACID) | Varies (Often BASE / Eventual) |
| **Querying** | Powerful SQL with complex JOINs | Varies; often simpler, no complex JOINs |
| **Best for...** | Financial systems, e-commerce, applications requiring high data integrity. | Big Data, social media, IoT, real-time web apps. |
