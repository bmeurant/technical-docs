# Transversal Programming Models

Unlike the primary paradigms of [[imperative-programming|imperative]] and [[declarative-programming|declarative]] programming, which define the fundamental way code is structured, **transversal models** (or cross-cutting paradigms) address specific problems that span across an entire application. They are not mutually exclusive and can be combined with other paradigms like [[object-oriented-programming|Object-Oriented]] or [[functional-programming|Functional Programming]] to solve complex challenges such as concurrency, data flow, or the [[cohesion-coupling|separation of concerns]].

## The Main Transversal Models

### 1. Concurrent Programming

Concurrent programming is a paradigm that deals with structuring a program to handle multiple, simultaneously progressing tasks. The primary goal is to improve throughput (by doing more work at the same time) and responsiveness (by not letting a long task block the entire application, such as a user interface).

It's important to distinguish concurrency from **parallelism**: 
- **Concurrency** is about *dealing* with many things at once (managing multiple tasks over a period).
- **Parallelism** is about *doing* many things at once (physically executing multiple tasks at the exact same instant, which requires multiple CPU cores).

#### Key Concepts
- **Processes and Threads:** Concurrency can be achieved with separate processes (which have their own isolated memory space, making them safer but heavier) or threads (which share memory, making them lightweight but introducing the complexity of shared data).
- **Synchronization:** To prevent data corruption when multiple threads access the same data, access must be controlled. This is done using synchronization primitives like **locks** (like a key to a single-occupancy restroom), **semaphores**, or **mutexes**.
- **Communication:** Concurrent tasks can communicate either by sharing memory (and using locks) or by [[message-driven|passing messages]] between each other. The latter approach, often formalized in the **Actor Model**, avoids many of the risks associated with shared state.

#### Common Challenges

- **Race Conditions:** Occur when the result of a computation depends on the non-deterministic scheduling of two or more threads. For example, if two threads try to increment the same counter at the same time, one of the increments might be lost.

  ```javascript
  // Shared state
  let counter = 0

  // Thread 1 runs:
  let value1 = read(counter) // value1 is 0
  // Thread 2 is scheduled here!
  let value2 = read(counter) // value2 is also 0!
  write(counter, value2 + 1) // counter becomes 1
  // Thread 1 resumes
  write(counter, value1 + 1) // counter becomes 1 again!
  // Expected result was 2, but one increment was lost.
  ```

- **Deadlocks:** A situation where two or more threads are blocked forever, each waiting for the other to release a resource.
- **Starvation:** A thread is perpetually denied necessary resources to process its work, often because other, "greedier" threads are monopolizing them.

### 2. [[reactive-programming|Reactive Programming]]

Reactive Programming is a paradigm centered around the concept of **[[event-driven|data streams]]** and the propagation of change. It offers a powerful model for handling asynchronous data flows and is particularly well-suited for applications that need to respond to a high volume of events, such as user interfaces, real-time systems, and microservices.

These concepts are explored in greater detail on the dedicated [[reactive-programming|Reactive Programming]] page.

### 3. Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)

Aspect-Oriented Programming is a paradigm designed to increase modularity by enabling the separation of **cross-cutting concerns**. A cross-cutting concern is a piece of functionality that is required in many different places throughout an application, such as logging, security, caching, or transaction management. AOP allows you to define this logic in one place (an "aspect") and apply it declaratively across your codebase, keeping your core business logic clean.

#### Key Concepts & Example
- **Aspect:** A module that encapsulates a cross-cutting concern. (e.g., a `LoggingAspect`).
- **Join Point:** A specific point during the execution of a program, such as a method call. In the example below, the execution of `myService.doWork()` is a join point.
- **Advice:** The action taken by an aspect at a join point. (e.g., `logBefore()`).
- **Pointcut:** An expression that defines *where* an advice should be applied. (e.g., `all public methods in the Service layer`).

**Pseudo-code Example:**
```java
// The Aspect: A module for our cross-cutting concern
aspect LoggingAspect {

  // The Advice and Pointcut
  // This says: "Before the execution of any public method in any class
  // ending with 'Service', run this block of code."
  before(execution of public * *.Service.*(..)) {
    log.info("Entering method: " + currentJoinPoint.methodName);
  }
}

// Business code remains clean, unaware of the aspect
class MyBusinessService {
  public void doWork() {
    // ... core business logic only ...
  }
}
```
When `myService.doWork()` is called, the AOP framework will automatically execute the logging advice before running the method, without `MyBusinessService` having any knowledge of it.

    This article introduces **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)** as a **programming paradigm** designed to **encapsulate and reuse cross-cutting concerns** such as **logging**, **security**, and **transaction management**. It defines the key **AOP** concepts (**aspect**, **advice**, **pointcut**, **weaving**) and explores implementation methods, including **Runtime Weaving** (Decorator, MediatR pipeline) and **Compile-Time Weaving**.

    This video from **Java Brains** presents **AOP** within the context of the **Spring framework**. It explains how **AOP** solves the issue of **cross-cutting concerns** by separating them from **business objects**. The application of the **aspect** logic (e.g., **logging**) is managed by **Spring** via external **configuration**, allowing the **advice** to be executed on **target methods** without modifying the core **business logic** [00:08:48].

### 4. Functional Reactive Programming (FRP)

Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) is a **purely functional** approach to reactive programming. Its goal is to eliminate the side effects that are common in mainstream reactive libraries (like the imperative actions in the `subscribe` block shown above) and to model the entire system declaratively.

In a true FRP system, everything is a stream, including UI properties and events. You build a system by describing the relationships between these streams. Instead of imperatively updating a UI element inside a subscription, you would declaratively state that a UI element's property *is* a transformation of some other stream.

**Pseudo-code Example:**

```javascript
// Define a stream of mouse positions from mouse-move events
mouse_positions = stream_of(mouse.x, mouse.y)

// Declaratively define the circle's position as being equal to the mouse position stream.
// There is no .subscribe() block with imperative commands.
circle.position = mouse_positions

// The FRP framework understands this continuous binding and ensures the circle's
// position always reflects the latest value from the mouse_positions stream.
```

This makes FRP a stricter, purely [[declarative-programming|declarative]] paradigm. It is particularly powerful for continuous-time systems like animations, complex UI interactions, and robotics, where reasoning about state changes over time without side effects is a major benefit.

    This article provides an introduction to **Functional Reactive Programming (FRP)**, defining it as the combination of [[functional-programming|Functional Programming]] (pure functions, immutable state) and **Reactive Programming** (automatic propagation of change, like a spreadsheet). It contrasts this **Declarative programming** style with **Imperative programming** and introduces the core concept of a **signal**â€”an observable **data stream** that sends values over time, which can be easily transformed using operators like **map**.
