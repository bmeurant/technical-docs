# Imperative Programming

The **imperative programming** paradigm is one of the oldest and most fundamental approaches to programming. It focuses on describing **how** a program operates by providing a sequence of explicit commands that change the program's state. Think of it as giving the computer a detailed, step-by-step recipe to follow. The code is a direct command to the machine, specifying each action in order: "do this, then do that, then change this variable."

This paradigm is built on three core concepts:
- **State:** The program maintains a state, represented by variables that store data in memory.
- **Sequence of Commands:** Instructions are executed in a specific, predefined order, using control flow statements like loops (`for`, `while`) and conditionals (`if-else`).
- **Mutability:** The state is mutable, meaning that commands can directly modify the values of variables as the program runs.

**Main Imperative Paradigms**: Imperative programming is primarily divided into two major sub-paradigms: **Procedural Programming** and **Object-Oriented Programming** but others paradigms can also fall into this category.

## 1. Procedural Programming

Procedural programming organizes imperative code into **procedures** (also known as functions or subroutines). These are blocks of code that perform a specific task. The program is essentially a master procedure that calls other sub-procedures to complete its overall goal.

This approach encourages a **top-down design**, where a complex problem is broken down into smaller, more manageable functions. Data is often stored in a separate set of variables and is passed between these functions as needed.

### Key Characteristics
- **Focus on Process:** The primary focus is on the sequence of actions or the "procedure" to be followed.
- **Functional Decomposition:** The main design activity is breaking down a task into a collection of functions.
- **Shared Data:** Data is often treated as a second-class citizen, separate from the procedures. It is passed around from function to function, and multiple functions may modify the same piece of shared data. This can become a significant drawback in large systems, as it becomes difficult to track data modifications, leading to bugs and high coupling.
- **Examples of Languages:** C, Pascal, Fortran, COBOL.

## 2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) evolved as a solution to the challenges of procedural programming, particularly the difficulty of managing complexity and shared state in large applications. OOP organizes code by bundling data and the operations that work on that data into single units called **objects**.

While still imperative at its core (methods of an object are sequences of commands), OOP shifts the focus from procedures to the objects themselves. Instead of data being passive and manipulated by active procedures, data and behavior are combined into active, self-contained objects.

### Key Characteristics
- **Encapsulation:** This is the cornerstone of OOP. An object encapsulates both data (attributes) and the methods (behavior) that operate on that data, creating a protective "capsule." The internal state is hidden from the outside world and can only be modified through the object's public methods, preventing uncontrolled access and modification.
- **Abstraction:** Objects hide their internal complexity behind a simplified public interface. For example, to drive a car, you use the steering wheel and pedals (the interface), without needing to understand the complex mechanics of the engine (the implementation).
- **Inheritance:** Allows a new class (subclass) to inherit properties and methods from an existing class (superclass), promoting code reuse.
- **Polymorphism:** Allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, enabling flexible and dynamic behavior.
- **Examples of Languages:** Java, C++, C#, Python, Ruby, Smalltalk.

These concepts are explored in greater detail on the dedicated [[object-oriented-programming|Object-Oriented Programming]] page.

## Key Differences Summarized

| Characteristic | Procedural Programming | Object-Oriented Programming |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Unit** | Procedures / Functions | Objects |
| **Data and Behavior** | Separated | Encapsulated together in objects |
| **State Management** | Often relies on shared or global state | State is contained and managed within objects |
| **Approach** | Top-down (breaking down tasks) | Bottom-up (designing objects first) |
| **Key Goal** | To execute a sequence of computational steps | To model real-world or abstract entities |
| **Complexity Management**| Through functional decomposition | Through encapsulation and abstraction |

In essence, while both paradigms tell the computer *how* to perform tasks, OOP provides a much more robust and scalable way to structure large and complex applications by organizing them around self-contained, stateful objects rather than a global, shared state.

    Defines the paradigm based on **step-by-step commands** that sequentially **change the program's state** (mutable state) using **Control Flow**. It focuses explicitly on *how* the program should achieve the final result.

    The **oldest** programming paradigm. Programs consist of a **clear sequence of instructions** (the "how") that directly manipulate variables. While easy to learn, it can lead to high **code volume** and **complexity** for large applications, unlike the [[declarative-programming|declarative paradigm]] (the "what").
